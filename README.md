Chevereto is a server-side software for creating a multi-user, full-featured media sharing solution. It is headless, providing a both auto-mapped and self-described REST API that allows to use it under many different situations and use cases.

It's your application. Your rules, your eyes. Say goodbye to closures, restrictions and data mining on your media.

## Use cases

You can use Chevereto to build your own image hosting service for your own personal use, to enhance your existing application, to provide media sharing for your community, to provide more value to your customers, etc.

It provides an extensible API, built on top of the [Chevere](https://chevere.org/) framework with support for addons. With Chevereto you can build _exactly_ what you need around your media. You can rely your project in a tested, solid, clean and highly-proficient code base, all maintained by a [highly-dedicated](https://github.com/rodolfoberrios) developer.

### Why Chevereto?

#### üåè Huge volume

Chevereto has been proved to be capable of manage collections big as 10 M images with a reasonable machine usage.

#### üßîüèæ Experienced

Born in 2007, Chevereto is a project with mature development with 4 major releases. Continuos updates are steady delivered.

#### üòâ Community driven

A [community](https://chevereto.com/community/) drives the development of Chevereto.

#### üèõ MIT Licensed

It is released under the MIT License, without the _caveats_ of other open source licenses.

#### üíé Modern architecture

Chevereto is PHP 8 software running under its own application servers. The application runtime can be tweaked to the bone for ultimate performance.

### Powered by Chevereto

There should be about **10~15K** Chevereto installations out there, each one hosting from zero up to ten million images. The following [notable websites](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/big-chevereto-hosts.8808/) are using Chevereto (any release).

## Contribution

The project is under alpha development and is not recommended to use it for production yet. However, developers (and those wanting to become) are welcome!

- Plenty application code from V3 needs to be updated to the new coding standard and application architecture
- I'm [ripping apart](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/features-to-deprecate-for-v4.11531/) all the _excess_ of features present in V3 (that plugins will be needed to keep some features)
- Documentation (for the Chevere framework)

## History

Chevereto project began in 2007 as a self-hosted alternative to services like ImageShack, Photobucket, Flickr, imgur, 500px, etc. Development has ben carried **all this time** exclusively by [Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com/) who works only in Chevereto.

It was released as Open Source software in February 2009, but due to lack of contribution the project went proprietary in 2011 with the introduction of V2. In April 2014, V3 was released and shortly after releasing it, licensing for V2 went free (MIT License) to open the software for more users.

On August 2016 a fork, named [Chevereto-Free](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto-free), was released to kickstart the process of turning all Chevereto into Open Source.

### Major Releases

| Version                                            | Date       | Licensing (release) | Licensing (actual) |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| [V1](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chevereto/) | 2009-02-26 | MIT License         | MIT License        |
| [V2](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto-2)     | 2011-06-15 | Proprietary         | MIT License        |
| [V3](https://chevereto.com/releases)               | 2014-04-05 | Proprietary         | Proprietary (*)    |
| [V4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto)       | TBD        | MIT License         | MIT License        |

(*) V3 will eventually merge with Chevereto-Free into MIT license.

## Funding

The intention has been always to make the project profitable to sustain its ongoing development and I've managed to making my living out of it. I'm proud of being able to focus exclusively on Chevereto development and nothing else.

### Extra features (license addons)

By [purchasing](https://chevereto.com/pricing/) a V3 license you get access to extra features and an additional support response. Paid licensing is still available for V3, and it represent the main source of income for the project ongoing expenses.

> **Note:** Most V3 paid features will be delivered as stand-alone plugins for V4. There will be a special plugin price for those coming from paid V3.

Chevereto won't be possible thanks to the support of all those who have purchased a license already. ‚ù§ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

### Custom development

Custom development is available, although it has a very tall price. However, if you want to build your application around Chevereto I'm your ultimate choice as I created on my own the entire framework and application architecture.

### Donations

The development of this software is a life project that has consumed many years of my time. **I don't work for any company**, I'm not backed by anyone else except users of this software.

Donations are welcome and highly appreciated and help to sustain development. You can send your one-time donation via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/RodolfoBerrios). Common assets required in development are also welcome like hosting, servers, computers, etc.

<!-- ‚ù§ I thank very much all my [donors](DONORS.md). -->

### Sponsoring development

Any [issue](https://github.com/Chevereto/chevereto/issues) or [RFC](https://github.com/Chevereto/rfc-sourcing/blob/master/RFC.md) can be sponsored to be pushed for development.

<!-- üëèüèæ My [sponsors](SPONSORS.md) get listed and their contribution is highly appreciated. -->

### Servicing

Usually Open Source endeavors benefit from the services related to the software itself like support, servers, moderation APIs, management, customizations, etc. However, I do self-hosted software. Not SaaS, nor hosting, neither distribution of a large scale service. To offer those services it will require me to put my focus in stuff that even being related, turns out to be completely different when running a business.

With Chevereto V4 I want to be focused _exclusively_ in the software so I'm encouraging others to provide the services and products needed for a better Chevereto experience:

#### Tech support

I've the intention of allowing third-party tech support. That way, others can deliver quality support under either my supervision or certification. Are you interested? Feel free to [contact](#contact) me.

#### Cloud

I want to run a [cloud](https://chevereto.cloud/) version of Chevereto. Are you someone with plenty experience in delivering cloud applications? Feel free to [contact](#contact) me.

## Alternatives

There are many software that overlaps with Chevereto in some functionalities so it could be the case that other software will fit better your particular needs. I recognize a serious (and ongoing) time investment, care and effort in these projects so please give them a try if you are into it.
