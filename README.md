# Chevereto V4

This is the repository for the fourth iteration for the Chevereto software. It contains the very early work in progress for Chevereto V4.

## Key features

### System design

- Headless CMS
- Pluggable architecture
- Self-described public HTTP API
- Streamed
- Made to work under application runners like [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) or [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)

### Application

- TODO

## Status: Under Development

At this time I'm finishing the [base framework](https://chevere.org/) used by this so expect to see many commits just for renaming stuff or moving assets everywhere.

The project is under beta development and is not recommended to use it for production yet.

## Contribution

There's plenty application code from V3 that needs to be modernized and updated to the new [coding standards](https://chevere.org/architecture/coding/coding-standard.html) inherited from Chevere. Also, many old systems needs to be completely re-implemented and re-licensed as MIT.

Also, I've the intention of ripping apart all the excess of features present in V3 as many stand-alone plugins.

It will help me a lot if I can get assistance in this because the legacy codebase is huge.
